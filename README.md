# Photonic-Circuit
24s1 INFO1110 Assignment
## Assignment Breakdown
* You will be implementing and emulating a (very rough approximation of) a photonic circuit. In a high-level overview, photonic circuits use lasers to emit photons (particles of light) which perform computation through their interactions with other photonic components. There are many parts we are leaving out, however our main goal is to build a simple emulation of the system which will give you first-hand experience on implementing a coding project from the ground-up, and hopefully be interesting enough for you to enjoy.
* You do not need any understanding of physics for this assignment, and indeed we will be doing it a degree of discourtesy by violating rules of quantum mechanics and in turn invent some elements whole-cloth (pure-fabrication).
* The assignment is broken down into separate features. These features are:
`SET-MY-CIRCUIT`
`GET-MY-INPUTS`
`RUN-MY-CIRCUIT`
`ADD-MY-MIRRORS`
